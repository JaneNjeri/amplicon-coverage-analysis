## Amplicon coverage

The amplicon_coverage script creates plots covering the 98 amplicons across SARS-CoV-2 genome for whole genome sequence data from MinION sequencer. Input for this script is coverage mask files generated by the ARTIC bioinformatics SOP for generating consensus genomes (https://github.com/artic-network/fieldbioinformatics).

### Setup
Install:
    1. Snakemake
    2. R packages:
        a. pacman
            `install.packages("pacman")`
        b. tidyverse
            `install.packages("tidyverse")`
        c. ggplolt2
            `install.packages("ggplolt2")`

### Run
Run the Snakefile with the `snakemake` command in terminal in your working directory that has a data dir with various run folders, for example run1, run2 etc and a results dir where the output goes.

### Output
In each run directory, we expect to see sample.pdf files for all your samples.

### Example
